🐾 Wildlife Trade Prediction
This project aims to predict and analyze patterns in illegal wildlife trade using machine learning and data analytics. As part of my internship, I contributed to building and optimizing models that detect potential illicit trade activities from structured and unstructured data sources.

🚀 Project Highlights
Objective: Predict wildlife trafficking trends and flag suspicious transactions to aid conservation and enforcement efforts.

Data Sources: Public wildlife trade datasets (e.g., CITES), customs and shipment data, and web-scraped news articles.

Approach: Supervised machine learning and natural language processing techniques were applied to detect patterns indicative of illegal activity.

Impact: Aimed to support NGOs, researchers, and law enforcement in identifying hotspots and trafficking routes.

🔧 Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM

Natural Language Processing: NLTK, spaCy, Transformers (BERT for text classification)

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Model Evaluation: Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC, Precision-Recall


💡 Key Features
Data Preprocessing Pipeline: Handling missing data, feature engineering, and text cleaning.

Suspicious Shipment Prediction: Classification model to predict if a trade record might involve illegal wildlife.

NLP Analysis: Topic modeling and entity recognition from news articles related to wildlife trade.

Interactive Visualizations: Trade trends over time, species-level insights, and high-risk regions.

Model Explainability: SHAP values used to interpret predictions.


🧠 Learning Outcomes
Gained hands-on experience in real-world data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.

Learned how to apply machine learning for social and environmental impact.

Collaborated with domain experts to understand context-sensitive data labeling and interpretation.
